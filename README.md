## About Me

My name is Brian, and I have been living and working in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I bring over six years of experience in software testing, with a proven track record of building and improving testing processes, as well as implementing automated testing solutions across diverse industries, including finance, banking, logistics, and more recently, human resources.

I am well-versed in Agile methodologies, particularly the Scrum framework, and have significant hands-on experience working as an Agile Tester within Scrum teams. My certifications as a Scrum Master, Google Project Management, and Software Testing Professional further back up my practical experience.

Throughout my career, I’ve developed a deep expertise in testing mobile applications, websites, and APIs. I’ve also led efforts in test automation, creating robust solutions for regression testing and API testing. For instance, I successfully implemented automated regression testing at ITL, and rolled out automated API testing at companies like Live Payments and Teamflow. These initiatives not only improved the speed and accuracy of testing but also significantly reduced the risk of serious issues making it to production.

As a leader, I have more than two years of experience managing test teams of 5-7 members. I take great pride in mentoring and upskilling junior testers, organizing training sessions, and sharing best practices. My contributions have been recognized with awards like the DNA Star at Home Credit, which highlight the value I’ve been able to bring to my teams and the companies I’ve worked for.

I’m passionate about ensuring high software quality standards, and I strongly believe in early testing involvement to detect issues before they escalate. By introducing comprehensive testing strategies and early-stage quality metrics, I’ve helped multiple organizations prevent critical bugs and minimize defect leakage.

In addition to technical skills, I thrive in challenging and fast-paced environments where I can bring my leadership, technical expertise, and problem-solving mindset to deliver real, impactful results.
